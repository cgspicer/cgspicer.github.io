title: Strength in Vulnerability
---

#### Sometimes we feel weak.
Society tells us to trudge on; to dig in, eyes fixed fast on the horizon. Indeed, the world around us moves onward and forward, dismissing our despondence. Sometimes, on the path forward you may need to stop, kneel, buckle, and break.
This is not a sign of weakness, it is a sign of strength. It is an indicator that your path is a difficult one and that you are coming to understand the significance of the journey. It is a sign that the path is worth taking.
Righteous paths are never easy because of a simple fact: we are not righteous. Through these journeys we are strengthened and humbled. The trial that breaks us is the trial that builds us.
It is important to stop and reflect, to express, to meditate and to pray. Let the world pass on, without you. Take a moment and be alone with your strengths and weaknesses and your trials. Try and remember, the strong are always tired.
